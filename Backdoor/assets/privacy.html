<h2>Backdoor Privacy Policy</h2>
Last Updated May 31, 2013 <br><br>

This notice describes BackDoor's privacy policy (hereinafter referred to as "Privacy Policy") and applies to the BackDoor mobile application ("BackDoor App").  This Privacy Policy applies to you, as a User of the BackDoor App and as an end user of the content provided by Users of the BackDoor App. 

<br><br>

PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING THE BACKDOOR APP. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE BACKDOOR APP.  BY USING THE BACKDOOR APP OR SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE BACKDOOR APP, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. Your use of the BackDoor App is also subject to the Terms of Service. Please review the Terms of Service, located at http://backdoorapp.com/terms for additional details regarding your use of the BackDoor App. All capitalized terms have the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service unless otherwise stated herein. 

<br><br>

Registration

<br><br>

During the registration process, you may be required to provide certain information and you will establish a username and a password. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete.  You agree not to share your password with any third party.

<br><br>

Protection of Minors

<br><br>

BackDoor does not permit children under the age of 13 to register on the BackDoor App or use any of its functionality for which registration is required. If you are between the age of 13 and 18 years old, you may use the BackDoor App but only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.

<br><br>

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

<br><br>

PII is information that identifies you or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, home or business address, email address, telephone number, and debit or credit card information such as the credit card number or billing address. BackDoor respects your privacy. BackDoor only collects PII through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email, survey information, and online registration forms. The types and amount of personal information collected from these activities will vary, but in no event will we collect PII that is not voluntarily given by you when using the BackDoor App. You consent to BackDoor using your PII to facilitate requests, to contact you if a problem arises, email you information about our BackDoor Apps, or for other uses consistent with this Policy and your requests. 

<br><br>

Sharing with Third Parties

<br><br>

BackDoor does not share your PII or any other information with third parties without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Policy. Should BackDoor merge with or be acquired by another company, any information collected may be transferred to and used by the resulting company. If BackDoor were to cease operations, your data might be transferred to and used by another company, which offers similar or related products. While we cannot predict a great deal about such an unlikely event, we would hope this would provide you with continuity of BackDoor App.  The BackDoor App gives you the ability to share your PII with other BackDoor Users.  Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information or data that might be accessible to others. 

<br><br>

Third Party Links

<br><br>

We may display links, and Users may post links containing content of a third party service or BackDoor App. You should always read the privacy policy of a third party BackDoor App to find out more about how personal information is collected and processed. BackDoor’s Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot fully control how, third parties use your information. Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for third parties' use of your PII or Non-PII. 

<br><br>

User Communications and Opt-Out

<br><br>

When you send email or other communications to BackDoor, BackDoor may retain those communications and related e-mail addresses in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our BackDoor App. In addition, BackDoor may use your username and email address to provide you with BackDoor news about products and/or BackDoor Apps and information about your user account. If you do not wish to receive these kinds of communications, you may "opt out" by emailing contact@backdoorapp.com. 

<br><br>

Legal Compliance

<br><br>

BackDoor may disclose any information we collect if required to do so by law or under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the law or comply with legal process or to protect and defend BackDoor's rights, property, and customers, whether or not required to do so by law. BackDoor reserves the right to contact appropriate authorities and disclose such information to them at our discretion when it appears that individuals using BackDoor's BackDoor App are engaged in activities that are illegal or violate the BackDoor Terms of Service.

<br><br>

BackDoor maintains a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your information and to deliver the BackDoor App and features of the BackDoor App. While BackDoor cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of your data will not occur, BackDoor works hard to prevent such occurrences.

<br><br>

<br><br>

Disclaimers

<br><br>

THE APP, BACKDOOR CONTENT AND USER SUBMISSIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, BACKDOOR EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. BACKDOOR MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE APP, BACKDOOR CONTENT OR USER SUBMISSIONS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS.
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM BACKDOOR OR THROUGH THE APP, BACKDOOR CONTENT OR USER SUBMISSIONS, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

<br><br>

Indemnity

<br><br>

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold BackDoor, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with User Submissions, your access to or use of the App, or BackDoor Content, or your violation of these Terms of Service.

<br><br>

Limitation of Liability

<br><br>

You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the App, BackDoor Content and User Submissions and any other content therein remains with you. Neither BackDoor nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the App,  BackDoor Content or User Submissions will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service or from the use of or inability to use the App or Content therein, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not BackDoor has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. You specifically acknowledge that BackDoor is not liable for the defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with you.

<br><br>

In no event will BackDoor's aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service or from the use of or inability to use the App or Content therein exceed  twenty U.S. dollars ($20). The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between BackDoor and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

<br><br>

Trademark Rights 

<br><br>

All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of BackDoor used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of BackDoor. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.

<br><br>

Controlling Law and Jurisdiction

<br><br>

These Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Service will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

<br><br>

Entire Agreement

<br><br>

These Terms of Service (including the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between BackDoor and you regarding the App and BackDoor Content, and these Terms of Service supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between BackDoor and you regarding the App and BackDoor Content.

<br><br>

Assignment

<br><br>

You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Service, by operation of law or otherwise, without BackDoor's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Service, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. BackDoor may freely assign these Terms of Service.

<br><br>

General

<br><br>

The failure of BackDoor to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of BackDoor. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Service will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Service or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Service invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE SUBMITTED WITHIN A YEAR OF THE DATE OF OCCURRENCE OR ELSE THEY ARE WAIVED.
